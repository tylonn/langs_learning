    "### The Python Data Model\n",
    "The first thing one should know when understanding advanced concepts in Python is that every item in Python is an object, which functions as an abstraction for data, encapsulating state (data) and behavior (methods). On top of that, these objects are characterized by having an `identity`, a `type` and a `value`. This characterization is important because it allows Python to manage an object's lifecycle throughout program execution. Let's dive a little deeper into how Python uses these items to manage its objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ID\n",
    "In Python, an object's identity never changes once it has been created. This identity can be thought of as the memory address of the object. In this scenario, the `is` operator is the way to compare the identity of two objects instead of `==`. Whereas, the `id` function returns the memory address of an object and this value is unchangeable. It is worth mentioning that the *id* sometimes is obtained through some optimizations, as listed below:"

    "In the above code we used two ways of calculating the size of a python object. `getsizeof` returns the size of the object passed to it only whereas `asizeof` returns the size of the object passed to it but also the objects referenced within the complex object instance.   \n",
    "In general, `getsizeof` only reports the raw memory allocated (header and its immediate contents) for the list's data and it is based on the interpreter's internal calculations.  \n",

It is important to note that it uses `getsizeof` to measure the size of the objects encountered and also take account of the extra space allocated by containers objects since some Python objects have over-allocation to amortized append operations, furthermore it also is capable of detecting shared objects, such as objects that are instances of classes with `__slots__` or some interned objects like strings. Although very useful, `asizeof` returns the estimated size of the objects plus all of it referents (_referents_ are objects acessible from the parent object according tho the traversal of its attributes and contents).  \n",
    "In summary, `asizeof` does the following:  \n",
    "1 - Indentify the object type;  \n",
    "2 - Consult a pre-defined table with estimated base sizes for different object types;  \n",
    "3 - Evaluate the content and (a) if applicable, recursively iterate through the object contents or/and (b) for each element, repeat the steps 1-3 to estimate the size and accumulate it to the total;  \n",
    "4 - Keeps track of objects by analyzing internal references within the parent objects and adds the contribution for referenced objects (avoidind double counting);  \n",
    "5 - Apply additional estimations for header infos and garbage collection, while avoiding double counting;  \n",
    "6 - Returns the summed up size of the traversed object.   \n",

They are present in pretty much everything that python touches due to its versatility. A nice example is list comprehensions, that can be used for a wide range of situations. Two nice patterns for using lists are for \"replacing\" map and filter, and for cartesian products, as demonstrated bellow. The use of list comprehensions is a neat approach to reduce code complexity and also can be very useful when delaig with sorted lists."

These objects can interact with each other in various manners, such as passing messages or invoking methods. Python also treats code as objects.
